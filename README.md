# ArcOS v7
### The start of a new era.
## About
ArcOS v7 is the next version of ArcOS, after 6.0.2, and the shutdown.

## Installing, and running locally
Either use the built binaries available from the [releases page](releases), or try running it yourself from source:
`git clone https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/v7/`
`yarn && yarn dev` or `npm i && npm run dev` for NPM.

## Contributing
Make sure to create a PR and detail your changes. We won't commit suspicious or small changes that don't do anything.

## About the OS
- All new look and feel, with the core components still in all of the right places.
- A new scripting language designed to make app development easy for ArcOS, whilst still being able to use JS/TS for your apps.
- An expansive set of included apps that do the basics; from text editing, file management and all the way to messaging other users who use ArcOS.
