You can use Safe Mode to fix problems that prevent ArcOS from logging in correctly. Safe mode:
<ul>
  <li>Disables third-party applications,</li>
  <li>Removes animations and transparency effects,</li>
  <li>Prevents user styles from activating, and</li>
  <li>Unloads various non-crucial apps</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you didn't activate Safe Mode on purpose, simply restart ArcOS. Safe Mode can always be activated by pressing <b>F8</b> on the
  boot screen.
